<h3 id="compat">Compatibility</h3>

<p>The plugin was developed under <strong>jQuery 1.9</strong> and (<em>for now</em>) had not been tested on older versions.</p>

<p>The plugin functionalities should be compatible with any web browser on any operating system.</p>

<p>If you find any bug or mis-compatibility, please post a message on website <a href="http://github.com/piwi/jQuery-AccessKey/issues" title="See online">http://github.com/piwi/jQuery-AccessKey/issues</a> with a description of the error in code or rendering. A test suite using <a href="http://api.qunitjs.com/" title="See online">jQuery QUnit</a> is <a href="test_suite.html">proposed in this package</a>.</p>

<h3 id="specs">Condensed summary of specifications</h3>

<p>As we can read in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2" title="See online">HTML4's W3C Recommendations</a>, the <var>accesskey</var> attribute can be used on the following tags <span class="note">I based this work on the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/Overview.html"><em>UUAG Test Suite</em></a>.</span>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#edef-A" title="See online">a</a> : the link tag, for which using the accesskey may ask the user agent to follow the link (<em>follow the <var>href</var> attribute</em>),</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#edef-AREA" title="See online">area</a> : for which using the accesskey may run the area's action,</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-BUTTON" title="See online">button</a> : for which using the accesskey may trigger a button's click,</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-INPUT" title="See online">input</a> : for which using the accesskey may select or focus the form field,</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-LABEL" title="See online">label</a> : for which using the accesskey may give the focus to the label, which gives it to its field (<em>through its <var>for</var> attribute</em>),</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-LEGEND" title="See online">legend</a> : for which using the accesskey may give the focus to the concerned fieldset (<em>there, the specifications are not very clear : the best practice may be to give the focus to the first fieldset's field</em>),</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#edef-TEXTAREA" title="See online">textarea</a> : for which using the accesskey may give the focus to the field.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html" title="See online">HTML5's W3C Recommendations</a> do not restrict the "accesskey" usage allowing its definition for any element.</p>

<p>Another difference is in the way to use the attribute : HTML4 says you must define the <var>accesskey</var> as a single character while HTML5 allows a list of characters, separated by space, where user agent must choose the first one available on the current user's device.</p>

<p>Be careful when developing about these usage differences between the HTML4 and HTML5 specifications.</p>

<h3 id="basis">Plugin implementations</h3>

<p>The plugin takes the HTML5 <u>"all elements" unrestraint rule</u> while it (<em>for now</em>) <u>do not allow to assign a list of accesskeys</u> but a single character, as in HTML4 (<em>take a look at the <a href="#todo">Todo section</a> of this documentation to learn more</em>).</p>

<p>As it seems to be the case in many operating systems, plugin considers any pressed key as a capital letter, even if the system finally attaches a lowercase key character to it. Be very careful at this point : it restricts available accesskeys to <var>[A-Z]</var> non-special uppercase characters and <var>[0-9]</var> numeric characters.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the default behavior of pressing an access-key constructed by the plugin depends on the concerned element type. These default behaviors are listed below ; note that you can overwrite them defining the <var>onClick</var> option value for each instances.</p>

<ul>
    <li>for a tag containing an <var>href</var> attribute (<em>such as <var>a</var> and <var>area</var> elements</em>), a click is triggered so the user agent is requested to follow the <var>href</var> value ; this can be forced using the <var>follow_href</var> value of option <var>onClick</var>.</li>
    <li>for a tag representing a form input field, the field is "selected" (<em>the user can directly enter a value</em>) ; this means that input type <var>checkbox</var> or <var>radio</var> are toggled (<em><var>checked</var> if they were not or <var>unchecked</var> if they were checked</em>) using the accesskey ; this can be forced using the <var>select</var> value of option <var>onClick</var>.</li>
    <li>for a tag representing a button, it is "selected" and it's action is toggled ; this can be forced using the <var>submit</var> value of option <var>onClick</var> ; be very careful here: <strong>this is the default plugin's behavior for "submit" or "reset" buttons or inputs</strong>, which means that the concernend form will be submitted or reset.</li>
    <li>for a label tag of a form field or button, the corresponding field is "focused" and that's it ; field's action is NOT toggled ; this can be forced using the <var>focus</var> value of option <var>onClick</var>.</li>
</ul>
